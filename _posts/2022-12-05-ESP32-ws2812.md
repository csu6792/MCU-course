**Setting up the leds** <br>
When writing programs for leds, and when writing code in general, I find it quite helpful to use named constants rather than bare numbers for things. What is easier to read and understand what's going on - or ? There's a couple of reasons for doing this. One is, as just shown, it makes code a little bit easier to read. The other is that it means you only have to make changes in one place if you, say, change how many leds you're working with.FastLED.addLeds<4,6>(leds,60);FastLED.addLeds<NEOPIXEL, DATA_PIN>(leds, NUM_LEDS);

```
#include <FastLED.h>
#define NUM_LEDS 60
#define DATA_PIN 6
```

**we need to set up the block of memory that will be used for storing and manipulating the led data**<br>

```
CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
```


This sets up an array that we can manipulate to set/clear led data. Now, let's actually setup our leds, which is a single line of code in our setup function:

```
void setup() { 
       FastLED.addLeds<NEOPIXEL, DATA_PIN>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
   }
   
 void loop() { 
        leds[0] = CRGB::Red; 
        FastLED.show(); 
        delay(30); 
    }
```

**loop led**<br>
```
 void loop() {
        for(int dot = 0; dot < NUM_LEDS; dot++) { 
            leds[dot] = CRGB::Blue;
            FastLED.show();
            // clear this led for the next time around the loop
            leds[dot] = CRGB::Black;
            delay(30);
        }
    }
```
