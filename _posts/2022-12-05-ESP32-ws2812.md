** Setting up the leds ** <br>
When writing programs for leds, and when writing code in general, I find it quite helpful to use named constants rather than bare numbers for things. What is easier to read and understand what's going on - or ? There's a couple of reasons for doing this. One is, as just shown, it makes code a little bit easier to read. The other is that it means you only have to make changes in one place if you, say, change how many leds you're working with.FastLED.addLeds<4,6>(leds,60);FastLED.addLeds<NEOPIXEL, DATA_PIN>(leds, NUM_LEDS);

```
#include <FastLED.h>
#define NUM_LEDS 60
#define DATA_PIN 6

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
```
